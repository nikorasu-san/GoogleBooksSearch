# GoogleBooksSearch

## Overview
This is a MERN web app to search books via Google Books API.

## Tech Used
**Front End:**
- React
- Bootstraps

**Back End:**
- Mongoose (ORM)
- Express.js
- Node.js

**Database**
- MongoDB

**Deployment**
- Heroku

## Future Development
- I found that some searches will glitch out the UI. This may be resolved by error handling in the API search.
- Add in confirmations for when a book is saved.
- Add in functionality to clear the value of a saved book.
